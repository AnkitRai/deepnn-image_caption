# deepnn-image_caption

This project is the implemention of Google's show and tell image captioning model with Flickr8K dataset instead of MSCOCO.
We also fine-tune model for different hyperparameters and experiment with different sequence modeling, i.e. using Gated Recurrent Units instead of LSTM, RNN, Bi-directional RNN.
For Image model -  Convolutional neural network, we use inception checkpoint provided by Google.

This is work in progress, we want to extend this work to perform video description generation from input video frames.
